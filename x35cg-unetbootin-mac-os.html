I'm hoping someone here has some experience with this issue as searching the internet has left me empty-handed so far. I have a Late 2009 Mac Mini that I'm trying to install Ubuntu on. I've tried everything I've found regarding booting from CD or USB (for some reason, the SuperDrive spits out my blank DVD+R's but will let me burn CD's just fine.)

I cant for the life of me figure out how to create a windows OS usb to boot on. exFAT wont boot and fat32 wont allow me to copy anything over 4gb (iso file is 5.8). Motherboard is ASUS rog strix B450F. Im creating the USB Boot on a mac. Am i doing something wrong with BIOS to not have it recognize exFAT or is there a way to make the .iso go on to a fat32 formatted USB. UPDATE: I have tried unetbootin and I just get a flashing I need to install Linux on a mac and unfortunately cannot use a USB flash drive and would need to use a DVD-r drive to hold the OS. I am not dual booting the system and will be erasing the whole mac to just have Linux (mint cinnamon). All the guides I have found use a USB drive and the software I have used in the past for loading the OS (unetbootin) seems to be locked to only accept USB drive as a storage medium in options. Any help would be appreciated and feel free to ask any questions. My laptop old OS was windows 10 and I accidentally installed kali linux on my hard drive (completely wipe out windows). Now i want to reinstall windows. I made a bootable usb with windows 7/10(tried both) but the pc won't load the usb and goes directly into kali linux system. I had this message after trying to boot from usb : Missing operating system. Anyone can help? I google everywhere but nothing works. I suspect that 1) the pc won't boot the usb because it doesn't recognize any windows. Hey Guys. So recently I installed Ubuntu 18.10 on my Dell Vostro 14 3468. After the Windows 10 update fiasco I wanted to try a Different OS. At first I settled for Chrome OS from Cloud Ready but that didn't have Play Store and I couldn't get ADB and Fastboot working on it. (I frequently flash Custom ROMs on my Android and working ADB and Fastboot is a must for me). Anyway then I tried Ubuntu 18.10, got it to work flawlessly. ADB and Fastboot too. Everything was good for about 3 hours. I tried. ''' Hello Reddit! I am having issues creating a bootable flash drive with Ubuntu 18.04 for a computer someone threw out. I read other posts saying that one can use a flash drive instead of hard drive which is what I am trying to achieve. I used a 16 GB flash drive and the program unetbootin for Mac. I created the flash drive boot drive but it didn’t work and I don’t know why. My guess is either that the program I used only creates the files to transfer the OS to a hard drive or that a computer. Greetings all. Recently went through the pains of installing Windows 10 (1809 ISO October 2018) in UEFI mode on an iMac mid-2011 (Mac 12,2) with an eGPU attached to it (modded Akitio Thunder2 + EVGA Gtx 1060). I setup my iMac to breathe new air into it and enable it to cope with the new hardware demands (graphics-wise) imposed by World of Warcraft BfA. Thought to drop a line or two in this sub in hopes of helping out folks that might be struggling to make this setup work in an efficient I'm having a difficult time getting the esxi 6.7 iso to be bootable. I've tried using Rufus, Unetbootin and CLI from Mac OS. I thought I may have downloaded the wrong iso but the iso boots when I load it in a fresh VirtualBox VM. I have been able to make a bootable CentOS iso's from the same usb drives i've tested, so I don't think it's defective usb drives. Here is the iso filename I've tried: VMware-VMvisor-Installer-6.7.0.update01-10302608.x86_64.iso Update: Finally got it working using. I have tried everything to get Windows 10 on my USB flash drive for my new PC. I have tried Unetbootin, Etcher, Boot Camp Assistant, and nothing is working! I thought I just needed to download the Windows 10 ISO from Microsoft and put it on a flashdrive, but I'm told I need to make it a bootable image, which I cannot seem to do! Any help with this would be so appreciated! I am on a Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.3. 
I have a GSA T4 (Dell 720xd). I'm trying to update it using the bootable ISOs from here: https://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/04/sln296511/updating-dell-poweredge-servers-via-bootable-media-iso?lang=en I have tried burning a DVD using an Apple SuperDrive, then connecting that Apple SuperDrive to one of the back USB ports.

I recently bought a used 13" mid-2007 MacBook and I have a few questions/issues I hope you guys might help me with. 1. It gets hot here ( and after a time (around 30 minutes, give or take) it shuts down. From what I understand, the region I marked is where the graphics chipset is located, so my guess is that's where the problem lies. Am I onto something here? I intend to remove the dust that undoubtedly has amassed inside since 2007 and replace all the therm. Hello so I previously fucked my macbook up by deleting my mac OSX thanks to some redditors I was able to download to a previous update than my original (10.6.8) and can't seem to update past Snow Leopard. Windows seemed logical to me so I would be able to run modern programs that aren't supported by this older OS. So I attempted to download Windows10 32bit since this Macbook 4,1 is a 32bit Intel Core 2 Duo with 4GB Ram, and then made a 8GB USB Flash Drive Master Boot Record and format to Fat32. I've been racking my brain for the past couple days trying to figure this out, maybe somebody can shed light on something I'm missing. I have macOS 10.13.4 installed on an SSD, everything seems to work fine except I can't get my computer to boot from the SSD, it'll only boot to the USB installer. I have UEFI enabled in the BIOS, but the neither the USB installer or my SSD show up as UEFI devices in the boot menu. I've made Linux USB sticks that have showed up, and can boot as, UEFI. They've. So my OS drive failed and I got a new one, but rather than put Ubuntu back on I thought I'd try ESXI but I can't for the life of me get it to install (the installer won't come up when trying to boot from USB). I'm on a Mac trying to install to a brand new SSD on an HP Microserver. Some things I've tried: - dd if=esxi.iso of=/dev/rdisk5 bs=1M - unetbootin - convert usb to FAT32, copy files out of the iso, mark the usb bootable So far, none of these work. The installer won't Hello, I am in the final stages of building and setting up my PC and just have the OS installation left. I have never done anything like this before. I created a boot drive using UNetbootin on my MacBook Pro and when I insert the drive into my computer case and go through the steps using the code that came with my disc, it will get to the install file screen and then appear to reset itself, taking me through the boot menu once again. How do I go about solving this issue and getting I put together a PC but have been unable to use it because I can't seem to get an OS to install. The computer turns on, enters BIOS, but despite numerous tries it would install the OS. I have a MSI B250m Pro-VDH motherboard and am trying to install Windows 10 using a flash drive. I've "installed" the OS to the flash drive, using a Terminal on a Mac, following instructions I found online. While the BIOS does recognize the USB, if I ever select it setup only goes says to insert a bootable drive.
